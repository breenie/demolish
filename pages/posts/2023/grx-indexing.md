# Indexing RD-RX810

1. Set the high limit screw so the centre of the jockey is aligned with the outside edge of the smallest sprocket
2. Set the low limit screw so the centre of the jockey aligns with the centre of the largest sprocket
3. Install the chain if you havenâ€™t already
4. Shift to the lowest gear and adjust the B-screw so the jockey is as close to the largest sprocket as possible without causing turbulence
5. Shift to the highest gear, adjust the B-screw to remove any slack from the chain
6. Turn off the clutch
7. Shift to the 2nd smallest sprocket
8. Turn the cable adjustment barrel anti-clockwise to add cable tension until you can hear noise from the chain rubbing the 3rd smallest sprocket
9. Turn the cable adjustment barrel clockwise to reduce cable tension until no noise is heard from the chain rubbing the sprocket
10. Operate the shifting lever to change gears while turning the crank, and check that no noise occurs in any of the gear positions
11. Turn on the clutch
12. If gear shifting from the largest sprocket becomes slow with the clutch on, adjust the jockey slightly further away by turning the B-screw

## Notes:

The high limit screw is the one closest to the largest sprocket and the low limit is closest to the smallest sprocket.

High gear is smallest sprocket, low gear is largest.

Adjusting the cable barrel clockwise moves the derailleur towards the smallest sprocket (releases tension)

Adjusting the cable barrel anti/counter clockwise moves the derailleur towards the largest sprocket (increases tension)
